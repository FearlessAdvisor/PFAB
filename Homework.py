sideA = 12.55
sideB = 17.85
Csquared = (sideA * sideA) + (sideB * sideB)

operand1 = 95
operand2 = 64.5
print operand1 , "+" , operand2 , "=" , operand1 + operand2
print operand1 , "-" , operand2 , "=" , operand1 - operand2
print operand1 , "*" , operand2 , "=" , operand1 * operand2
print operand1 , "/" , operand2 , "=" , operand1 / operand2
print operand1 , "%" , operand2 , "=" , operand1 % operand2
#this soultion is best because if either operand changes, no code needs to be rewritten
